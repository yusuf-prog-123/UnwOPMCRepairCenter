# UnwOPMCRepairCenter
This is a logistic application designed for a repair facility that will take used home networking devices (ADSL routers, ONT, ZTE) that are returned from customers and categorize them as configured or defective after checking the router, the categorization allows us to extract just repaired devices. A database is created with mysql and a <b>SQL connecter library</b> is used on the jave netbeans project to connect to the SQL database that has already been created. This is made for the repair shop inorder to provide high effeceincy when taking care of huge load of network devices that are being returned from customers.
